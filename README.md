# antevorta-db
## The database module for Antevorta

* This module handles the storage of the data, access to the data, and storing temporary data as networks are being created and trained. Anything that goes into any of the DBs will go through this module. 

* This module handles API access. The API is **very** basic and requires talking to me about getting access. The point of this work isn't to write a fancy API; you make a DB request and get json back. There is an example client to look at, and you need a config file with username and PW. 
 
 * At some point this will be a public repo, the API isn't designed to be secure, just a simple way for me to stop random people from scraping github and grabbing a ton of data. Due to the insecure nature and my lack of interest in putting together proper DB sanitization / best practices, it's unlikely I'll give you access if I don't know you. However, if somebody decides they want access and puts together a proper API I'll probably be happy to integrate it.
