        - These tables need to be created in a specific order due to foreign key constaints on some tables.
        - All tables reside in the same DB shards.

        1st table: links_table
            - Contains the mapping between movielens_movieid, tmdb_movieid, and imdb_movieid. Multiple other tables need
             to know this mapping as some data comes from movielens, some from tmdb, and there will be additional imdb
             data. Multiple foreign keys, on non-primary key columsn, would be necessary so the subsequent tables will
             instead reference this table during creation. Insertions are less efficient, selections are more efficient,
              and storage requirements are less efficient.

            int     autoincrement       // primary
            int     tmdb_movieid        // The movie id found in the tmdb data
            int     imdb_movieid        // The movie id found in the imdb data
            int     movielens_movieid   // The movielens id from the movielens dataset
            No indices


        2nd table: genome_tags
            - Contains a tagid and the tag name. The tags are genres and other related words for movies

            int     autoincrement       // primary
            int     tagid               // The id of the genome tag
            text    tag                 // The genome tag
            No indices

        3rd table: genome_scores
            - Contains 60 of the most popular movies in the movielens dataset, as well as a FP relevance score for every
             genome tag in the dataset -- 1128 entries for each of the 60 movies

             int    autoincrement       // primary
             int    tmdb_movieid        // The movie id found in the tmdb data          (select from links_table)
             int    imdb_movieid        // The movie id found in the imdb data          (select from links_table)
             int    movielens_movieid   // The movielens id from the movielens dataset
             int    tagid               // The id of the genome tag
             real   relevance           // A FP val denoting how relevant a specific tag is to the movie, normalized 0-1
             Index for relevance for potential future use to compute least relevant tags
